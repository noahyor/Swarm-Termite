Thanks for contributing to Swarm!  Please replace this template with a
description of the changes in your pull request.

- Note that when the pull request is merged, this pull request
  description will be used as the message on the resulting single
  squashed commit.  So you should write your PR description with an
  audience of future developers and users in mind.

- If your PR fixes a specific issue or issues, be sure to include a
  phrase like "fixes #nnn" or "closes #nnn" somewhere in the
  description, so GitHub will automatically close the relevant issue
  when your PR is merged.

- If your PR is a substantial user-facing change (i.e. something other
  than a typo fix, refactoring, etc.), give it the CHANGELOG label to
  suggest it for mention in the next release changelog.
