# The Swarm Community

We hope that Swarm can be a catalyst for community---that many people
will be able to have fun playing, discussing, and collaborating on
Swarm together.  Here are a few resources to help you get plugged into
the community and connect with others.

- Everyone is welcome in the Swarm community.  Note the [Code of
  Conduct](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md),
  which specifically governs those contributing to the project on
  GitHub, but by extension the whole community.
- The [Swarm Discord server](https://discord.gg/kp8MuSgkPw) is open to
  all.  At the moment, the server is primarily used to discuss
  development, but you're welcome to use it to discuss anything
  Swarm-related (*e.g.* asking for help, showing off your cool
  programming exploits, *etc.*).
- Feel free to make use of the [Swarm
  wiki](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/wiki) on Github as a place to
  collaborate, discuss strategy, post cool robot programs, create
  documentation, or whatever.
- We are open to other community-building tools and spaces, depending
  on the desires of people in the community, especially as the
  community grows. For example, GitHub and Discord might be fine while
  there are just a few people hacking on it, but eventually people are
  going to want a place to post their cool screenshots, get help
  debugging, and discuss strategies.  In general, anyone should feel
  free to take the initiative on such things.  For example, someone
  could start a Discourse forum, or a mailing list, or something else,
  and we will add it here!
