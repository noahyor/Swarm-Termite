  An illustration of how to use `imap`{=snippet} to translate.  A basic patch is
  created and then overlaid at various translations.  Note that since
  `imap`{=snippet} works by mapping a function over the coordinates, translation
  is "backwards": for example, `imap (x+4)`{=snippet} translates 4 units to the
  *left*.
